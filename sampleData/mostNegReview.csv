4.0,7,2011-02-02,A3747YPXOBXRAT,0977153487,"the dresden files rpg is a staggering achievement. a system in which anything can happen, yet which folds that assumption into a structured environment that usually works predictably and well (albeit with a steep learning curve for the old-school rpg player/gm).

this review is for the hardback first edition of the dresden files rpg: volume 2: our world.

the book is well made, using identical production standards and techniques as those used in volume 1: your story and reviewed by many, me included. the full-color pages are stitched into a cloth binding and bound between two sturdy cardboard covers featuring evocative artwork suitable to the milieu. well made, and if you don't get it wet it should last for years.

the content is a mixture of stuff.

there's a section on how the various ""laws"" work to the advantage and disadvantage of the characters of the dresden files books, and the various factions directly involved in and with them.

there's a section on the active wars taking place as we speak in dresden's world.

there's a section on the supernatural in dresden files, which also includes a ""monster manual"" of things that have been met, avoided or mentioned in passing in the published dresden files novels, along with their stats for use in the game (otherwise why have the entries on them in the first place?). this is where you'll find ghouls, ghosts and sue the zombie tyrannosaur.

there's a section on the cast of the published stories to date (i believe there were ten books in the series at the time our world was being compiled). this is where you'll find marcone, murphy and fix.

there's a section which forms a gazetteer of weird chicago, the setting of the dresden files books (or at least, where dresden lives and where the stories usually start). even if you plan on not running your game in weird chicago, this section will be valuable in seeing what sort of things you'll have to bring to the table when you make weird sheboygan or (as i did for a convention recently) weird plainview, weird new york. (some might argue i cheated because new york is already weird to start with.)

it is, all in all, an indispensable book for the gm.

what i *don't* understand personally is one reviewer's comments that this book is ""better"" than your story. they form a complementary set for a gm - he or she will need both books to run a campaign - but players will find our world of limited use in a game (and possibly a total spoiler bring-down into the bargain). bottom line: you can play dfrpg with only your story. i can't envision the same being done with only our world, and the publishers never intended that you should try.

if you are a gm who has purchased your story and you are thinking of setting your campaign in some other town than chicago (as per the first chapters of your story) you will still find this volume useful, albeit not *as* useful, for its ""monster manual"" content (and you should keep your eyes open for a promised volume ""dresdenifying"" baltimore).

there's a lot to be said for relocating your own campaign to a different locale than that of the jim butcher books - for one, players won't keep saying ""well, why don't we just tell dresden and get the heck out of dodge?""

i found the convenience of playing in the city that is well described in butcher's books *and* depicted in the show *and* whose denizens are already statted-up (by people far more in touch with the dresden files universe than i will ever have time to be) to be more than enough excuse to site my game there.

(though dfrpg characters don't really *have* stats in the traditional rpg sense they *do* have a character sheet and it can be a lot of work to figure out what should be on it for a given character when you've not much game-prep time in hand and only a passing knowledge of the character in question.)

a star falls off my review because of the same graphic design elements i found problematic in the your story volume (please refer to my review of that for details) and which are just as problematic in my experience in this volume, and for the lousy index, which suffers from the same problem i complained of in my review of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/dresden-files-rpg-volume-one-your-story/dp/0977153479/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">dresden files rpg volume one; your story</a>.",Great Resource for the GM,0.058,0.896,0.046,-0.8097

but before i continue let me tell you that infiltration is based upon the android board game universe (which i have no knowledge of) in a steam-punk feel.

but maybe i can sum it up better by saying; this is a techy heist game where back stabbing and running through a facility stealing information is the ""order-of-the-day"" (much like the 1992 film ""sneakers"" with robert redford, however the game's characters are much more selfish and don't really work together like in the film).

the rule book is beautiful but lacks a lot of information. i have had so many questions about game play and details, that i've had to go searching on the web for answers. since this isn't a popular game, i've had to go to fantasy flights web and email them my questions, which they've never answered (ultimately i figured out the game).

since then, the game has sat on my shelf and no one in my gaming circle willing touch it. however a recent trip to los angeles, i broke it out with gamers that i had never met, and they all agreed it was one of the worst games ever printed.

stick with me, and i'll explain why.

problems with this broken game are;
 - your character can become wounded by a security guard or a room and this can knock you out of the game. keep in mind there is only 2 rare ways to become healthy. extremely frustrating for the player just sitting there doing nothing.
 - if you become the first player to take a turn, you have dominance over the rest of the players by snatching up all the data tokens ahead of everyone else (and one player dominates the game). i call this the ""mario-bros-2-player-video-game-effect"" (where one player runs ahead and gets all the game coins/stars and other goodies). and the second player is swimming in his digital wake. i've won this game and i felt so bad for everyone else, i couldn't wait to move on after apologizing to them.
 - it appears that a ratio of 1-in-5 item cards actually help negate the run-away-player problem (and some item cards really are useless)... but unless you get those cards, your screwed.
 - layout of the room cards are non-nonsensical and are laid out in an arc? the secret room sometimes cannot be even entered, and this is a problem too.
 - also, this game has very little strategy or real flavor. run through... snatch data tokens... run back before the alarm goes off... bam... done... boring.
 - the characters have no special abilities on their cards and every one of them are flat and lifeless. the game maker should of used colored cubes and numbers in place of players names because that is the level of character painted on theme here.

there are other problems with this game, but clearly every time i break it out, people can't wait to finish it to move onto another game.

i have heard the game was designed by the maker of dominion, a well known and popular fantasy card game, but since i have not played dominion, this is a mute point with me.

don't get me wrong, fantasy flight did produce a beautiful game and the quality of the pieces are ""first-rate"", but it doesn't save the mechanics and details of game play.

to end:

simply stated, infiltration is completely flat and lifeless. i feel nothing towards it and i intend on selling it soon. players don't care about the characters and the way the game is tailored players don't care who wins the game. sadly i feel no sadness when i kill a company worker in the building and some innocent employee getting ""knocked-off""? (is that necessary? most thieves aren't interested in murder on top of their stealing crimes). in infiltration there is no greater alliances with other players and no consequences to almost anything. and when you don't care who wins and when you the player is dead to the circumstances, why play it?

don't buy it unless you plan to make your own rules. instead i advise you to go buy ""can't stop"" a great push your luck game or ""elder sign"" another semi-push-your-luck game. this one is terrible.",Infiltration a broken game,0.177,0.718,0.105,-0.9969

it is a little costly, but the base stats (3 attack, 3 defense, 2 hull and 3 shields) are pretty good. it can also do four different actions, and take many different kinds of upgrades.
pilots include:

(1) knave squadron pilot, a level 1 non-unique pilot that costs 27 points (yikes!).

(2) blackmoon squadron pilot, a level 3 point non-unique pilot that costs 29 points.

(3) ethan a'baht, a level 5 unique pilot that costs 32 points, with very nice offensive special ability that reads, ""when an enemy ship inside your firing arc at range 1-3 is defending, the attacker ay change 1 of its [hit] results to a [crit] result.""

(4) corran horn, a level 8 unique pilot that costs 35 points, with another great offensive special ability that reads, ""at the start of the end phase, you may perform one attack. you cannot attack during the next round."" just missed destroying a ship this round?  corran horn lets you try again!

it also includes two previously released upgrades (flechette torpedoes and advanced sensors), one upgrade that also comes with another wave 4 ships (outmaneuver -- a 3 point elite talent that reduces your targets agility by one if you are not also in their firing arc), plus two astromech droids that were exclusive to this expansion at the time it was released (r7 who costs 2 points and lets you spend your target lock to make an attacking ship reroll any number of attack dice; and r7-t1 who costs 3 points and let you perform a free boost action when you acquire a target lock on a ship inside your firing arc).

as with all expansions, this one includes all tokens, dials, etc. that you need to use this ship in a game (though a copy of the base set is still needed to play).

given that the cheapest one costs 27 points you'll never need more than three for a standard 100 point game.  at a minimum, i think it adds enough to get one or two, which is what i did to start.",Definitely worth getting at least 1 for the upgrades and unique pilots,0.133,0.748,0.119,-0.8534

first, you get 4 new pilots (including 3 unique pilots with some very nice special abilities).  unique pilots include:

boba fett (the baddest bounty hunter in the galaxy), a level 8 pilot, whose special ability reads, ""when you make a bank maneuver, you may rotate your dial to the other bank maneuver of the same speed."" this gives you lots of flexibility to set up or avoid an attack.

kath scarlet, a level 7 pilot whose special ability reads, ""when attacking, the defender receives 1 stress token if he cancels at least 1 critical hit.""

""krassis trelix"", a level 5 pilot whose special ability reads, ""when attacking with a secondary weapon, you may reroll 1 attack die"".

it also includes a generic ""bounty hunter"" pilot with no special ability so you can use more than one of this ship in a game if you'd like.

second, it also includes many upgrade cards (most of which are exclusive to this expansion set at the time it was released): homing missiles, assault missiles, ion cannon (with a 90 degree firing arch , which is different from the y-wing ion cannon turret which has a 360 firing arch), heavy laser cannon, veteran instincts (increases your pilot skill by 2), expose, seismic charges and proximity mines (both are bombs you can release as part of your move and they each work in different ways), gunner, mercenary copilot, 2 stealth device (a 3 point upgrade that lets you increase your agility by 1 until you are hit the first time), and slave 1 (even though it is called slave 1 on the box, the expansion is really for the generic firespray-31... this upgrade cards lets you actually call it the unique slave 1 and gives you a minor special ability if you do). it should be noted that some of the upgrades can only be used on this ship, while others can be used on any ship for either side.

finally, it has two firing arch (a 90 degree firing arch in front, and a 90 degree firing arch in back).  you can fire your primary weapon using either firing arch, but you have to fire secondary weapons from the front firing arch).  one drawback is that the base is so big it's hard to maneuver (that is, to avoid asteroids and other ships so you don't lose your ability to attack or take actions that turn).

the expansion also includes all tokens, dials, etc. that you need to use this ship in a game (though a copy of the base set is still needed to play).

given all the nice new things it adds to the imperial side, i think it is definitely a worthwhile addition to the game.","Great to Have Boba Fett, the Badest Bounty Hunter in the Galaxy, in the Game",0.144,0.728,0.127,-0.8115

i think this is one off the most ambitious releases from fantasy flight games to date.  it includes 3 ships (i.e., two alternative paint 2 z-95s and one alternative paint y-wing), with everything you need to play them with the scum faction.  and, it also includes everything you need to modify one each of your current slave 1 and hwk-290 ships so you can use them with the scum faction.  plus, it includes tons of new upgrades, many of which can also be used on current rebel or imperial ships.  given everything thats included, im guessing most players will want one and probably even two of this expansion.

it should also be noted that all the base stats for each ship are the same as in the previous releases (so, ill not be reviewing those again here).  but, the ships and pilots have changed, so ill be reviewing those in detail below.

z-95 headhunter

(1) ndru suhlak, a level 7 unique pilot that costs 17 points whose special ability reads, when attacking, if there are no friendly ships at range 12, roll 1 additional attack die.

(2) kaato leeachos, a level 5 unique pilot that costs 15 points whose special ability reads, at the start of the combat phase, you may remove 1 focus or evade token from another friendly ship at range 12 and assign it to yourself.  note that this takes a token from an friendly ship, as opposed to the hwk's palob godalhi who lets you take it from an enemy ship (see below).

(3) black sun soldier, a level 3 non-nique pilot that costs 13 points.

upgrade cards

in addition, this expansion includes a whopping 19 upgrade cards, seven of which can also be used by rebel and/or imperial ships (ive included details on some of my favorites below). the list of upgrades includes autoblaster turret x2, k4 security droid (a crew that lets scum ships acquire a target lock after executing a green maneuver), greedo, outlaw tech (a crew that lets your scum ships acquire a focus token after executing a red maneuver), bomb loadout x2 (a 0 point which allows y-wings to take a bomb upgrade instead of a torpedo upgrade -- can be used by rebels), r4-b11 (which allows you to spend your target lock to make the defender reroll any defense dice you chose), genius (which allows you to drop some bombs after rather than before you move), r4 agromech x2 (which allows you to acquire a focus token after spending a target lock on an attack), salvaged astromech x2 (which allows you to discard this card to also discard a face up damage card with a ship trait), unhinged astromech x2 (which allows you to treat all 3 speed maneuvers as green maneuvers), hotshot blaster (which can be discarded to perform an attack outside off your firing arc), btl-a4 y-wing x2, and andrasta (which gives an additional bomb slot to any firespray  can be used on an imperial firespray).

as with all expansions, this one includes all tokens, dials, etc. that you need to use this ship in a game (though a copy of the base set is still needed to play).

all things considered, i think this expansion (especially in tandem with the new faction) adds a ton of new things to the game. and, given that at seven of the upgrades can be used by rebels and/or imperials, i think even those folks who are not interested in playing the scum faction will find getting at least one comes in handy.",Most Wanted Expansion (Part of the New Scum & Villainy Faction),0.146,0.756,0.097,-0.9965

5.0,9,2015-03-02,A3GM64N13BILUP,1633440206,"the star wars: imperial assault dice pack contains 11 dice for use in fantasy flight's imperial assault miniature game. these dice are not the standard 1-6 most games are played with, but have special symbols and numbers on them that make them useable in imperial assault and derived games only. you get two black defense dice, two red melee/damage dice, two blue long range dice, two green midrange dice, two yellow short range dice, and a single white dodge/defense die. they had a suggested retail price of $11.95 on release in late february/early march 2015.

there isn't a whole lot to say about these dice. they are identical to the ones that come in the imperial assault box set (unless your set had one of those rare misprinted defense dice with circles instead of triangles on it, which would explain why you want new ones). if you want another set to let the players use during a campaign game (only using one set for both sides during said campaign can be a bit annoying), they are currently your only option unless you intend to purchase another boxed set. if you are attempting to get into imperial assault ""on the cheap"" and only purchasing the dice pack and specific miniature expansions... well, it is marginally possible, but you'll still need the cards for a command deck (primarily found in the boxed set) and a partner that can provide the tiles/map to play on. to put it bluntly: that path is not recommended.

the dice themselves all have six sides, and are pretty much only good for use in the imperial assault game (or throwing at people when you get angry at them, but that can put someone's eye out and get you banned from your local place of play). they can be stacked one on top of the other when you get bored, but 8-sided and 20-sided dice are far more challenging (and, thus, more interesting) to do that with.

the servo worked three or four times, after that it overheated for no reason so it seems it had some electronic short circuit. i contacted the seller and they sent me another servo with no charge. the battery runs for almost 25 minutes but charge time is 7 hours so i bought a tenergy charger it charges a 3800mah battery in a couple of hours and it should give me 50 minutes of fun.

the front dog bone came unassembled but i had the tool to tighten it so no problem with that. if you want spare parts look for hsp which is practically the same as exceed.

2017 update: here is the list of the upgrades i've done:
- servo savox 1256 on the front axle, and a generic one on the rear, so it runs 4 wheel steering (4ws), and a few extra parts for the rear steering. (best upgrade for this rc)
- esc wp1060 from hobbywing (optional)
- 18003 aluminum caster mounts (front only, recommended for high torque servos)
- 18009 aluminum main gears (both, absolutely necessary))
- aluminum wheel hex (soon, recommended)
- removed bumpers for more clearance (optional)
- 18021 wheel weights (all wheels), helps traction even with cheap stock tires (recommended)

here is the list of the parts broken:
- 18002 rear gear box (front only, probable related to high torque from servo)
- 18006 caster mounts (front only, got stuck between rocks, so the high torque from the servo broke one of the casters)
- 18009 main gears (it's cheap plastic)
- 18016 wheel hex (just one)
- 18025 front and rear bumpers (not used)
- 18090 motor (failed and was replaced by seller)

first, the ""pop-o-matic"" takes considerable force to operate.  my five year old had to put his full 50lb body weight onto it just to get it to work, and it was difficult for my old son to operate too.

second, the ""have to roll a six to get to start"" rule is stupid.  you just wait forever to get to even start to play.  we changed the rule so you can start with either a six or a one, and that helped a little bit.

i echo other reviewers who say the readout is difficult to see.  the contrast is so low that it is hard to see in regular room light.  this is a big deal when you're looking for the decimal point.  ""1.5"" looks like ""15""  this really frustrated the girls because they were trying to add up the purchases.

my 6 year-old daughter really likes the actual-sized money and large buttons on the register, but the fact that the register is really a calculator is confusing at times when it comes to dealing with money.  for instance, $4.50 reads on the calculator as 4.5 - not how we usually represent money.  also, to give change back, you either have to start with what the customer gives you and then re-enter the total or hit the ""-"" sign and ignore or explain the negative number.  for instance, if the total comes to $4.50 and you give a $5 bill, the total will read 4.5.  to make change, you either have to clear the total and enter ""5 - 4.5"" or start with the total and enter ""- 5"".

had i realized the implications of having a calculator rather than $ notation to a 6 year-old, i would have chosen a different cash register that always displays 2 decimal points (4.50 instead of 4.5) and allows you to make change more easily.  i believe there's another learning resources cash register that does this.",Calculator can be confusing to kids just learning money.

the fact is that random chance doesn't make a very interesting game for adults (unless you're making bets, i suppose), and it doesn't make a very interesting game for children either if they're used to games with more strategy involved. (my young nieces, for example, *will* ask a lot for candyland - but only because i am not willing to play it with them very often.)

some people think that the lack of strategy makes these games easy for young children, and that's probably true, but it also makes it frustrating for them - they hit a losing streak and they have *no way* to turn it around, and they know that. i have never seen the same frustration with losing in games like sleeping queens or crazy eights that i have in candyland - and, tellingly, when my older niece loses crazy eights she pouts and then asks to play again. when she loses candyland, she pouts and puts the game away!

some chance is good in a game for kids - it levels the game. but i do not think a game that is entirely based on luck is a good idea.

instead of candyland, i'd reccommend a game with some level of skill involved - memory, or froggy boogie, perhaps.

there is no reason you and your kids have to be resigned to games of capricious fate.

edit: i've found out why my niece likes this game at all. it's not for any aspect of the game itself - it's because when she loses or wins due to chance, we have her ""draw a bedroom"" for herself, or for us. we started doing it because she got too frustrated and upset at losing through no fault of her own.",Highly overrated,0.191,0.713,0.096,-0.9847

remember when we were growing up and toys were built to last?  remember when a scientific toy actually taught scientific principals?

my kids have received numerous gifts under the name of scientific american over the years, and each one lasted under a day before it broke.
add the ""meteor rocket"" to that list.

this terribly manufactured toy takes an hour to build and 30 seconds to destroy.  if you are considering buying this for your little ones, know that they will need a sharp utility knife (not supplied), scissors (not supplied), tape (not supplied), a ruler (not supplied), baking soda (not supplied), vinegar (not supplied), and plenty of patients.

also not supplied is a discussion of the chemical reaction taking place that produces the gas.

once you manage to cut the balsa wood fins and attach them to the rocket, it's time to head out to a field and try this puppy out.

unfortunately, the pressurization system is as crappy as the materials.  it is a rubber stopper with a screw attachment that is supposed to keep the stopper in the mouth of the bottle.  the idea is that a tube stuck on the end of the stopper is supposed to keep the vinegar and baking soda from reacting while you tightening the stopper.

the reality is that it's really difficult to keep the rocket on its side while you carefully place the tube inside without spilling a single grain of soda.  if even a bit reacts, you will not be able to get the stopper to stay in.  the tightening mechanism does not work.

the only way we got a ""flight"" was to mix the chemicals and push the stopper in as hard as we could, allowing the rocket to launch while holding the stopper.  the result of course of a shirt covered with vinegar and baking soda.

if you have never played don't break the ice, the object is to try to make a game last more than two minutes, which is unlikely. after spending several minutes putting plastic cubes of ""ice"" into a frame, each player takes a turn using a flimsy plastic mallet to knock out only one ice block at a time. the person who knocks down a 2x2 block of ice with some skating bear-dog-yeti thing on it is the one who loses. there are several strategies out there that are equally likely to not be all that entertaining including the bash like crazy strategy, the engineer who takes 20 minutes to take a turn strategy, and the ""maybe i can make this thing float with my mind"" strategy. either way, the actual playtime on a given round is almost always shorter than the time spent setting up. my kid is able to help me set it up now, but i have to do some of the later pieces.

i don't know why or when they changed the style of this game but it's a complete rip off. the game i played as a child was well made with a thick plastic base, and tiles that were hooked well into the base, the tiles never bumped each other as you flipped them down, and the pictures rested securely and flat inside each tile, not bowed out and folded (after much use) in the tiles.

so where did this item lose the next three stars? about 2 months of minimal play use from my 9 month old the star stopped clicking... it turned without resistance. i figured who cares? the clown is the star of this show anyways. then the clown decided to enter his terrible twos and refused to go to bed. well, he refused to get back in the box. my husband attempted to fix the toy but didn't have any success. he said at least whatever broke, broke inside and thus didn't give our little one pieces to choke on. so there's that at least!

anyway, with that said, monopoly junior is a really fun game for young children to play. it helps kids learn to take turns, follow directions, and learn basic counting skills. in many ways the game is just like monopoly. the goal is to end the game with the most money. you have to have a strategy involved (if you don't play by rules included with the game). properties are bought and there are a lot of money transactions. the major differences are that the game is set up as an amusement park; the money denominations are a lot smaller; the board is smaller; and it only takes about 20-30 minutes to finish one game. there is a bit of luck involved with the various chance cards, but that's no different than the chance cards in monopoly.
the kids i have worked with really seem to enjoy playing the game, and i really don't find that it is ""dumbed down"". the game is made with kids in mind instead of adults and cuts out a lot of the brutality common to the regular game. kids see enough violence nowadays anyway.",Not Too Bad.,0.091,0.809,0.1,-0.6359

we capture every thought and make it give up and obey christ (2 corinthians 10:5b ncv).

heres the secret to temptation: dont fight it. just refocus. whatever you resist persists.

did you know that in the bible, not once are you told to resist temptation? we are told to resist the devil, and thats a whole different issue. but the key to overcoming temptation is not to push back. its to change your focus.

whatever gets your attention gets you. the battle for sin always starts in the mind. thats why the bible says in psalm 119:6, thinking about your commands will keep me from doing some foolish thing (cev). why? because if you're thinking about gods truth, you're not thinking about the less important stuff.

its true in every single area of life  good or bad. if you focus on godly things, its going to pull you that direction. if you focus on the stuff thats at the movies and in magazines, its going to pull you that direction. whatever you focus on gets your attention. whatever gets your attention is going to get you.

4.0,3,2015-09-06,A2YV6F6DLENNTM,B00000IWD3,"i had this game as a kid and i loved it so i was so excited to find that it's still made and get it for my 3 1/2 year old daughter. the game is intended for preschool age and requires no reading, but does require some knowledge of colors and counting. in the box, you get the daddy bed, the game board, 8 character cards (a boy and a girl for each of the four bed colors in case there are 4 girls or 4 boys playing), a spinner, and colored object cards to help you move along the board. the object of the game is to make it to the refrigerator for a late night snack amidst all the noisy objects you may step on on the game squares without waking daddy up.

each player receives colored object cards at the beginning of the game and when you spin and land on a particular object, such as the pots and pans or the roller skates, and you do not have the card, you'll need to press daddy's alarm clock button however many times are indicated on that card. for example, if you land on the dishes, you have to press the alarm clock button 8 times. then you can take the object card from the player who has it. if during your turn daddy wakes up, you have to go back to bed and start all over.

unfortunately, the quality of the game is not what it used to be and this reissued version is mediocre quality. i bought the first one and was so disappointed with it because every 2-3 pushes of the alarm clock button, the daddy would wake up, which meant you had to keep starting the game over and no one could advance past the first few squares on the board. it was frustrating! i exchanged the game and the second one has been working perfectly, getting as many as 20 pushes of the button before daddy wakes up, always varying in number each time. the cards are printed on thin cardstock, so if they were thicker, they'd last a lot longer without getting bent and torn.

overall, this is a really fun game that we enjoy despite the quality issue.","Fun Game But Quality is Lacking, Had to Exchange the First One After It Broke Within 2 Days",0.078,0.86,0.062,-0.6504

one complaint, when you attach the round base it looks as if you can easily fold it under the board to put it back in the box.  this is not the case, you simply have to detach it and reattach the next time you play.  but other than that, no complaints here.","It's Connect4, what more can you say?",0.107,0.837,0.056,-0.844

first of all, i don't like that this game has exactly 40 cherries, 10 for each player.  as soon as one is lost, this is no longer a 4-person game, and given that this is a game for preschoolers and the cherries are tiny, losing one is almost a given.  i think an extra strip of 10 should be included.

this is one of those games that's like the bunny hop.  however, it's more random and a lot less particular.  you have 2 cherries, then 3, then 1, then 5, then 7, then 0 and begin again.  i'd prefer a game that was a bit less random jumping all over the place.  and, it's not only occasional to be wiped out completely.  there's a 1 in 7 chance each turn of losing them all, and an additional 2 in 7 chance of losing 2.  there's really no way to tell if the end of the game is in sight, which can be frustrating for young children and their parents.

finally, there is a lack of logic in this game that bugs me.  if the dog or bird eats some of the cherries in your bucket or you spill them, then they go back on the tree.  how does that make more cherries grow on the tree?  with the game setup, this was kind of unavoidable, but still....

the game is fine, but i almost never pull it down to play with my kids (5 of them ages 8 and under).  there are better ones out there, some of which we have, like pengoloo or the ladybug game.",Hi-Ho Cherry-O is only Ho-Hum,0.096,0.85,0.054,-0.9413

we had initially bought her a different car, the chicco 4 in 1 ride on car, which we thought might be better because it changed from a rocker to a self-push car for when she's older.  but, in fact she didn't like it very much.  i think part of it was that the seat was so wide that it forced her legs to spread out and it wasn't comfortable.  she never wanted to be on it, so we returned it to the store.  this step 2 car is very comfortable for her.",Better Than the Chicco Car - My 9 Month-Old LOVES It!,0.083,0.858,0.059,-0.8003

pros:

-easier to operate compared to the imaginarium express train<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/imaginarium-power-steam-engine-set/dp/b007u7h4j6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">imaginarium power steam engine set</a>&nbsp;we bought before. both trains work on an aaa battery and the battery replacement is through the screw on the chimney. however, to reach the screw you need a thin and long screw driver for imaginarium whereas it is much more accsible for this model. besides, you do not need to allign the metal circuit bits that carefully with this model which is a pain for the other one.

-grasps the track well. that was the reason i returned our previous battery powered thomas&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/thomas-wooden-railway-battery-operated-thomas-the-tank-engine/dp/b009nffywm/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">thomas wooden railway - battery-operated thomas the tank engine</a>&nbsp;train which was not very much compatible with tracks other than thomas itself. the engine was unable to turn the curves and was getting off the track so frequently that it would not even complete one turn without the need for intervention. compared to that model, this grasps the track well and does not get out of the track even in the sharpest corners.

-small enough for thight spaces such as tunnels. bigger trains do not fit into fancy structures such as curved passage ways that are sold as accessories for some wooden track systems (we have an imaginarium express wooden track set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/imaginarium-timber-log-train-set/dp/b009ix0bls/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">imaginarium timber log train set</a>&nbsp;which has curved elevations in narrow passages and bigger engines get stuck in those places)

cons:

-it is very simple with no attractive drawings on it. the imaginarium and thomas trains look way more appealing compared to this model.

-weak: it can climb elevations okay but at an extremely low speed. it almost feels like the battery is about to die very soon (even just after replacing it) aaa is the wrong choice for battery. it should have been an aa at least for proper and sustainable power thomas was a way stronger engine.

-you need many rechargable batteries since a single aaa does not even last an hour.

-price:.at $20 this is pricier than the previous models i had and i think it does not deserve more than $12-13.

the only thing i really disliked. (nothing to do with the actual product) was the packaging.
trying to get the dang thing out of the box required a screw driver. then because the screws were screwed in so tight the heads got stripped and i then had to get a flat head screw driver to ply off the piece of wood that was sandwiching the card board packaging to cranky. i then needed pliers to twist the screws out.
2 screws screwed out ok, however i did some difficulty because they were so shallow, but screwed in tight.
the other two screws would not come out with the screwdriver.

there is a little basin on the bottom for each player. so the tube body part rotates so that when the marbles fall, it falls on that player's basin. but the frustrating thing is, the whole tube body is wobbly. just by rotating it, the balls could fall through and mess up the game. so this job isn't for little hands. i have to sit with the kids and rotate it for each player.

the other frustrating thing is there is no way to store the game without the marbles and sticks falling out. the box it came in is not a hard one so it's destroyed once opened. then the pieces don't just stack properly in order to just put the marbles and sticks together. there's just no way easy way of storing it so the pieces don't get lost.","Fun for kids, but cheap quality",0.083,0.849,0.068,-0.8287

4.0,6,2000-11-27,A1NSMQIF1C2VCE,B000038AAW,"""diablo"" is something of a compromise between true rpgs and arcade games like ""gauntlet."" basically, it's all about going into a hole in the ground, killing what's there and looting the bodies. the quests and puzzles really aren't challenges, but rather let you know what sort of critters to kill and loot.
having said that, the game is addictive, especially when playing with another person (who preferably is using one of the other classes of character available in the game). roaming the dungeon under tristram, hacking your way through hordes of demons and the undead, all for an even shinier and fancier new weapon or suit of armor -- or, most fun, more spells for your sorcerer -- is a great way to kill an afternoon, and a sure cure for bad days at work.
the graphics in the playstation version are a slight improvement over the disappointing computer graphics -- the camera is zoomed in significantly, letting you see what's going on in the dimly lit dungeon -- and the interface, while not as intuitive and relatively unobtrusive as the one in ""diablo ii,"" works extremely well and the learning curve for most players will be very short.
two player mode, while lots of fun, does have some limitations, mainly that both players are trapped on a single screen together, and a zealous partner can inadvertently trap the other character behind walls or barrels in the middle of a widespread melee.
the violence here is gory, and there's references to violence against the young prince of the land, but for the game is far less graphic and intense than most horror movies, and should be something that teenagers can handle quite easily.
the game also has appeal for adults who've tired of the thinking involved with ""warcraft"" (or who have experience with paper-and-pencil rpgs) and just want to smite some demons.
and while ""diablo ii"" isn't yet available for any videogame console systems -- and will likely suffer when it does -- this bargain-priced original game will serve as a good primer on the game and its setting and sets the stage for the computer game sequel.
a solid game despite its age, and one well worth owning.","Great fun and a good primer for ""Diablo II"" on computer",0.14,0.739,0.121,-0.9529

when my heart starting skipping beats unexpectedly due, apparently, to chronic stress, i decided i needed a stethoscope on hand for quick assessments of my heart beat during my palpitation periods. amazon is my standby in these emergencies and, among the expensive ""med student"" options, there was this learning resources toy. the results, in my opinion, are mixed.

first, this is not the most sensitive of stethoscopes. the heart beat is softer than more expensive stethoscopes, probably to lessen potential damage to a child's eardrums if the stethoscope is mishandled. (seriously, that would be a huge concern of mine before handing this toy over to a child. hearing loss is permanent and should not be flirted with.) the stethoscope realistically picks up every errant movement or flutter of clothing, so the user must hold very, very still in order to get a decent read on the already soft-sounding heart rate.

second, as others have noted, the hearing pieces on this stethoscope hurt. i can't leave the stethoscope in my ears for more than a minute or so. the hearing pieces are fairly big (i'd estimate larger than a small child's ear could comfortably accommodate, but i can't say with certainty), very hard, and press inwards strongly, and at an uncomfortable angle. attempts to ""stretch"" the metal out a bit have failed so far.

bottom line, though, is that this stethoscope does work for what i purchased it for, even if it doesn't work as well or as painlessly as i'd like. i can monitor my heart during periods of bad heart activity, although i dislike that the stethoscope is too painful to use for frequent ""spot checks"". i can't imagine that this would be a particularly sturdy toy - if i have to keep the chewy rubber away from inquisitive cats, i'd have to think that small teeth could so just as much, if not more, damage. although i suppose the majority of children don't chew on their toys past age 5, a younger brother or sister could wreak a goodly amount of havoc on this toy.

the stethoscope is well made, but sadly my 4-year-old has been on a destructive streak lately, and he damaged it beyond repair so we had to get rid of it. still, this is not due to bad product design.

2.0,2,2013-02-19,A3ALIEK3IK3RVV,B00004YO0Y,"when my 3.5 year old saw the box he immediately wanted to try it out and go fishing.  he first tried it without a battery installed and was able to manage it ok.  the fishing poles like to swing a lot when you move them, so he had to hold the rod at the midpoint just to keep it still enough to get it in the fish's mouth.  now, once i installed the battery (1 c battery) and turned it on, the difficulty increased dramatically.  the game spins fairly fast and the fish don't have their mouths open for very long.  trying to hook one on a swinging fishing pole can become a little frustrating, even for me.  now i love a challenge, but if the playability of the game is more of a frustration than it is fun, then the game has lost its appeal.  the parts are cheaply made and i wouldn't be surprised if it didn't last very long.  out of the box, a number of the fish's stickered eyes had either fallen off or were missing.

it's a good game in that it helps to refine motor skills, but the application and construction of the game is a little too frustrating and disappointing to make it a worth while game.

and he had to hold them still this game is a little frusthere are four plastic fishing poles that pivot and rock when you move it.  you lower the pole over the fishes mouth and wait for it to open, but the fishing pole

to clear up a few things: 1) the game uses 1 c battery, not 2 aas. 2) there is no music as stated in the product description. 3) the fishing pole and fish are not magnetic as in other, smaller, wind-up versions of this game.

my biggest complaints are that it spins a little too fast, which means that the fish don't keep their mouths open for very long. and because the fishing pole is two plastic pieces with a small cone/cup shaped plastic knob (which is only a little smaller than the fish's mouths) instead of a magnet on a string as in the small, wind-up versions, catching fish isn't all that easy. it's not terribly hard, as i got the hang of it in a few minutes, but it's definitely not as easy as in the magnetic versions.

lastly, the reason some people have trouble putting the game back into its box is because some of the fish are still in their ""up"" positions (sticking up, with their mouths open). you just need to rotate it manually until all fish are in their ""down"" positions. but be sure to only rotate it the way the thing normally rotates, though, otherwise you might damage it.","Good In Concept, But Can Be A Little Frustrating",0.108,0.813,0.079,-0.9545

5. little tikes' customer service is slow but nice.
cons:
1. it came with missing and defective parts.
2. the edges/corners of many pieces require extensive trimming/sanding.  they are not smoothed out or nicely trimmed at the factory, potentially dangerous to toddler's knees, hands, or elbows, as she/he climbing in and out the unit.

here you have a sturdy dual twisting set of ramps.  the slightest touch sets off an irritating electronic noise (presumably of race cars whizzing past) that you cannot turn off (fisher-price seems to have a thing against on-off switches on its toys).

placing two plastic race cars at the top of the ramps and starting them sends them spiraling downward at a rapid pace with the said noise reverberating around your eardrums.  if your child is playing with this on a carpet, the cars roll ahead about 4 inches; if he/she is playing on a hard floor, they roll a whopping 8 inches forward.  if you are not careful, the lightweight cars will end up underneath the sofa or tv stand, making them impossible to find again.

doesn't this sound exciting?

i tried very hard to get my son interested in this playset.  i set up the cars, ""revved"" the engines, and asked him to race my car.

he ignored me and continued playing with his mega blocks.

on the rare times he paid attention to this dud, he would try and race his matchbox and hot wheels cars down the ramps, but they were too large.  only the two cars that come with this set work.

i really don't see what all the excitement is. this toy doesn't offer anything that sitting down a reading a book to your child doesn't. when just reading a story, the voice is flat and emotionless. not very exciting. my three-year-old can't seem to follow the directions (point to the green circle) and i don't know if she doesn't want to (she's independent) or doesn't quite understand. whith practice, hopefully she'll get better. some of the games are a little advanced, but might be better for a five-year-old, especially the rhyming games in ""wocket.""

the biggest problem, though, is the design. the on/off button is located in the lower right corner. if you're right handed, your wrist lays across the on/off button. it take barely any pressure to turn it on or off. the default on the volume is set to very, very low, so often she'll turn it on, not realize it's on, then turn it off trying to make it work.

the other mechanical problem is with the cartridges. if you have the wrong cartridge (or no cartridge) in, it sings songs, tells rymes, washes dishes -- everything except say, ""please insert the correct cartridge.""

4.0,,2010-02-08,A16PPE8U5G9IZL,B00005BXJ0,"i actually bought this gun 3-5 years ago, and since becoming something of an experienced ""nerfer"", it has been carried around in a bag with several other nerf guns.
what you get in this product is a fully automatic nerf gun that holds 20 darts.
it comes with suction darts, but so far any of the micro darts work fine (i prefere the nerf tag velcro darts. more likely to stick to victims :-).
the gun does need to be pumped up like a super soaker, so there is that draw back to loading time, not to mention you need to place each dart into it.
and it shoots fast. and i mean fast. in a matter of seconds you've shot off all 20 darts. i was in a nerf war a couple weeks ago where everyone had hit points, and thus when hit enough you're tagged out. i finished off my friend (who hadn't bee hit yet that game)on the other team with this gun. on single fire (would have put it on rapid fire had i been thinking).
and that brings me to another feature: it has a dial to select between single and rapid fire. rapid being the super fast fire setting, single fire being more of a slow rapid fire setting.
another thing i want to point out is that there seems to be a release valve in the pumping mechanism, meaning when you pump it up enough, it starts to release extra air, thus protecting the gun from having too much pressure. you'll hear the gun hiss as you pump when you've reached that point.
this seems to be a pre- n-strike design, so there's no clip like system here. all the darts simply go in the front. and with looser darts, darts can fall out of the front of the gun, so i recommend holding it level, never down.
but that's the only weakness, that and the prep time. otherwise, awesome gun. i really can't think of any other gun that can top this in ammo capacity and fire rate.
and btw, this gun retails at about $35.00. at the time of this writing, it's a target exclusive, so i'd recommend checking there first before dishing out $50+",One beast of a Nerf gun,0.166,0.729,0.106,-0.9782

1.0,12,2002-12-10,A1S7BFT0HDF3HA,B00005EB9M,"first, i have to agree with most other reviews posted already regarding both the incorrect answers and oddball questions. it's as though the creators tried to include only the weirdest situations or the most arcane notions. hence, the game is reduced largely to guessing multiple choice answers. because nearly every question and answer is so strange, it's hard to see what can be educational about the game.
still, in my opinion, what really plagues this game is that it is just not that much fun. basically, you move your game piece across the board a certain number of spaces determined solely by rolling the die. of course, you have to guess the answer first, and the younger kids are not going to have a clue. (hmmm, maybe there is a way to play without the questions. . . .) there are no obstacles on the way, and there is not way to send an opponent back home or into a tar pit or into a rattlesnake nest or some sort of worst case scenario that might instill some interest into this game.",Weird Case Scenario,0.111,0.819,0.07,-0.8412
