i've had plenty of hands on tactile 'toys' and this one should have delivered but it really falls short in comparison.

the object is to rearrange the pieces to an unlimited amount of variations including 'real' or abstract shapes. the problem is that the magnets are not really strong enough so they tend to slide around way to much to hold a shape. we have made a bunch of star shapes (we being my kids age 6 and 11) but even they are running out of ideas. the best thing is if you drop the ball, it shatters into 30 pieces.

2.0,2,2013-05-01,A1AJWJGB89GSIL,1616613963,"i bought this game after seeing some positive reviews and an interesting premise, however things went badly after i broke it out with my gaming group.

but before i continue let me tell you that infiltration is based upon the android board game universe (which i have no knowledge of) in a steam-punk feel.

but maybe i can sum it up better by saying; this is a techy heist game where back stabbing and running through a facility stealing information is the ""order-of-the-day"" (much like the 1992 film ""sneakers"" with robert redford, however the game's characters are much more selfish and don't really work together like in the film).

the rule book is beautiful but lacks a lot of information. i have had so many questions about game play and details, that i've had to go searching on the web for answers. since this isn't a popular game, i've had to go to fantasy flights web and email them my questions, which they've never answered (ultimately i figured out the game).

since then, the game has sat on my shelf and no one in my gaming circle willing touch it. however a recent trip to los angeles, i broke it out with gamers that i had never met, and they all agreed it was one of the worst games ever printed.

stick with me, and i'll explain why.

problems with this broken game are;
 - your character can become wounded by a security guard or a room and this can knock you out of the game. keep in mind there is only 2 rare ways to become healthy. extremely frustrating for the player just sitting there doing nothing.
 - if you become the first player to take a turn, you have dominance over the rest of the players by snatching up all the data tokens ahead of everyone else (and one player dominates the game). i call this the ""mario-bros-2-player-video-game-effect"" (where one player runs ahead and gets all the game coins/stars and other goodies). and the second player is swimming in his digital wake. i've won this game and i felt so bad for everyone else, i couldn't wait to move on after apologizing to them.
 - it appears that a ratio of 1-in-5 item cards actually help negate the run-away-player problem (and some item cards really are useless)... but unless you get those cards, your screwed.
 - layout of the room cards are non-nonsensical and are laid out in an arc? the secret room sometimes cannot be even entered, and this is a problem too.
 - also, this game has very little strategy or real flavor. run through... snatch data tokens... run back before the alarm goes off... bam... done... boring.
 - the characters have no special abilities on their cards and every one of them are flat and lifeless. the game maker should of used colored cubes and numbers in place of players names because that is the level of character painted on theme here.

there are other problems with this game, but clearly every time i break it out, people can't wait to finish it to move onto another game.

i have heard the game was designed by the maker of dominion, a well known and popular fantasy card game, but since i have not played dominion, this is a mute point with me.

don't get me wrong, fantasy flight did produce a beautiful game and the quality of the pieces are ""first-rate"", but it doesn't save the mechanics and details of game play.

to end:

simply stated, infiltration is completely flat and lifeless. i feel nothing towards it and i intend on selling it soon. players don't care about the characters and the way the game is tailored players don't care who wins the game. sadly i feel no sadness when i kill a company worker in the building and some innocent employee getting ""knocked-off""? (is that necessary? most thieves aren't interested in murder on top of their stealing crimes). in infiltration there is no greater alliances with other players and no consequences to almost anything. and when you don't care who wins and when you the player is dead to the circumstances, why play it?

don't buy it unless you plan to make your own rules. instead i advise you to go buy ""can't stop"" a great push your luck game or ""elder sign"" another semi-push-your-luck game. this one is terrible.",infiltration a broken game,0.177,0.718,0.105,-0.9969

the servo worked three or four times, after that it overheated for no reason so it seems it had some electronic short circuit. i contacted the seller and they sent me another servo with no charge. the battery runs for almost 25 minutes but charge time is 7 hours so i bought a tenergy charger it charges a 3800mah battery in a couple of hours and it should give me 50 minutes of fun.

the front dog bone came unassembled but i had the tool to tighten it so no problem with that. if you want spare parts look for hsp which is practically the same as exceed.

2017 update: here is the list of the upgrades i've done:
- servo savox 1256 on the front axle, and a generic one on the rear, so it runs 4 wheel steering (4ws), and a few extra parts for the rear steering. (best upgrade for this rc)
- esc wp1060 from hobbywing (optional)
- 18003 aluminum caster mounts (front only, recommended for high torque servos)
- 18009 aluminum main gears (both, absolutely necessary))
- aluminum wheel hex (soon, recommended)
- removed bumpers for more clearance (optional)
- 18021 wheel weights (all wheels), helps traction even with cheap stock tires (recommended)

here is the list of the parts broken:
- 18002 rear gear box (front only, probable related to high torque from servo)
- 18006 caster mounts (front only, got stuck between rocks, so the high torque from the servo broke one of the casters)
- 18009 main gears (it's cheap plastic)
- 18016 wheel hex (just one)
- 18025 front and rear bumpers (not used)

2.0,4,2014-12-31,AW6PBNDI624W4,B00000DMD2,"update: the fact that the cash register is really a calculator was confusing to a 9 year-old in addition to my 6 year-old.  the older girl is well into learning money, and she was expecting a real cash register readout.

i echo other reviewers who say the readout is difficult to see.  the contrast is so low that it is hard to see in regular room light.  this is a big deal when you're looking for the decimal point.  ""1.5"" looks like ""15""  this really frustrated the girls because they were trying to add up the purchases.

my 6 year-old daughter really likes the actual-sized money and large buttons on the register, but the fact that the register is really a calculator is confusing at times when it comes to dealing with money.  for instance, $4.50 reads on the calculator as 4.5 - not how we usually represent money.  also, to give change back, you either have to start with what the customer gives you and then re-enter the total or hit the ""-"" sign and ignore or explain the negative number.  for instance, if the total comes to $4.50 and you give a $5 bill, the total will read 4.5.  to make change, you either have to clear the total and enter ""5 - 4.5"" or start with the total and enter ""- 5"".

had i realized the implications of having a calculator rather than $ notation to a 6 year-old, i would have chosen a different cash register that always displays 2 decimal points (4.50 instead of 4.5) and allows you to make change more easily.  i believe there's another learning resources cash register that does this.",calculator can be confusing to kids just learning money. would choose a register that displays money notation and makes change.,0.071,0.879,0.049,-0.7235

the fact is that random chance doesn't make a very interesting game for adults (unless you're making bets, i suppose), and it doesn't make a very interesting game for children either if they're used to games with more strategy involved. (my young nieces, for example, *will* ask a lot for candyland - but only because i am not willing to play it with them very often.)

some people think that the lack of strategy makes these games easy for young children, and that's probably true, but it also makes it frustrating for them - they hit a losing streak and they have *no way* to turn it around, and they know that. i have never seen the same frustration with losing in games like sleeping queens or crazy eights that i have in candyland - and, tellingly, when my older niece loses crazy eights she pouts and then asks to play again. when she loses candyland, she pouts and puts the game away!

some chance is good in a game for kids - it levels the game. but i do not think a game that is entirely based on luck is a good idea.

instead of candyland, i'd reccommend a game with some level of skill involved - memory, or froggy boogie, perhaps.

there is no reason you and your kids have to be resigned to games of capricious fate.

edit: i've found out why my niece likes this game at all. it's not for any aspect of the game itself - it's because when she loses or wins due to chance, we have her ""draw a bedroom"" for herself, or for us. we started doing it because she got too frustrated and upset at losing through no fault of her own.",highly overrated,0.191,0.713,0.096,-0.9847

remember when we were growing up and toys were built to last?  remember when a scientific toy actually taught scientific principals?

my kids have received numerous gifts under the name of scientific american over the years, and each one lasted under a day before it broke.
add the ""meteor rocket"" to that list.

this terribly manufactured toy takes an hour to build and 30 seconds to destroy.  if you are considering buying this for your little ones, know that they will need a sharp utility knife (not supplied), scissors (not supplied), tape (not supplied), a ruler (not supplied), baking soda (not supplied), vinegar (not supplied), and plenty of patients.

also not supplied is a discussion of the chemical reaction taking place that produces the gas.

once you manage to cut the balsa wood fins and attach them to the rocket, it's time to head out to a field and try this puppy out.

unfortunately, the pressurization system is as crappy as the materials.  it is a rubber stopper with a screw attachment that is supposed to keep the stopper in the mouth of the bottle.  the idea is that a tube stuck on the end of the stopper is supposed to keep the vinegar and baking soda from reacting while you tightening the stopper.

the reality is that it's really difficult to keep the rocket on its side while you carefully place the tube inside without spilling a single grain of soda.  if even a bit reacts, you will not be able to get the stopper to stay in.  the tightening mechanism does not work.

the only way we got a ""flight"" was to mix the chemicals and push the stopper in as hard as we could, allowing the rocket to launch while holding the stopper.  the result of course of a shirt covered with vinegar and baking soda.

and once the bottle opening becomes wet, it is impossible to create a good seal with the stopper.

a much better and virtually free chemical rocket can be found on the steve spangler website.  it uses things you have in your house to build the rocket.  the only thing you'll need to buy is a rubber stopper.  plus, the site actually talks about the reaction that's happening.",scientific american has no pride,0.075,0.883,0.042,-0.9119

i don't know why or when they changed the style of this game but it's a complete rip off. the game i played as a child was well made with a thick plastic base, and tiles that were hooked well into the base, the tiles never bumped each other as you flipped them down, and the pictures rested securely and flat inside each tile, not bowed out and folded (after much use) in the tiles.

this game is such a waste of money. i will now begin what i'm sure is a long search for an original game from 1989-1995 through collectors, ebay and other places where i might find an original. i'm so disgusted that this is the way things have gone w/toys and games these days. cheap materials, crappy workmanship, poor execution in design and a jacked up price-tag!",what ever happened to well made games/toys?,0.096,0.824,0.08,-0.9134

so where did this item lose the next three stars? about 2 months of minimal play use from my 9 month old the star stopped clicking... it turned without resistance. i figured who cares? the clown is the star of this show anyways. then the clown decided to enter his terrible twos and refused to go to bed. well, he refused to get back in the box. my husband attempted to fix the toy but didn't have any success. he said at least whatever broke, broke inside and thus didn't give our little one pieces to choke on. so there's that at least!

i don't think i'm nit-picking. i have 3 little ones and i have tons of cool toys that we paid less than $20 for that have worked without fail since receiving or purchasing them back in 2012 for our first child. i don't think it's unrealistic to believe a $20 jack in the box should last for a long time.... now to dig through my parents attic and find that one with the pinching hinge.",not a quality toy,0.091,0.851,0.058,-0.8871

first of all, i don't like that this game has exactly 40 cherries, 10 for each player.  as soon as one is lost, this is no longer a 4-person game, and given that this is a game for preschoolers and the cherries are tiny, losing one is almost a given.  i think an extra strip of 10 should be included.

this is one of those games that's like the bunny hop.  however, it's more random and a lot less particular.  you have 2 cherries, then 3, then 1, then 5, then 7, then 0 and begin again.  i'd prefer a game that was a bit less random jumping all over the place.  and, it's not only occasional to be wiped out completely.  there's a 1 in 7 chance each turn of losing them all, and an additional 2 in 7 chance of losing 2.  there's really no way to tell if the end of the game is in sight, which can be frustrating for young children and their parents.

finally, there is a lack of logic in this game that bugs me.  if the dog or bird eats some of the cherries in your bucket or you spill them, then they go back on the tree.  how does that make more cherries grow on the tree?  with the game setup, this was kind of unavoidable, but still....

pros:

-easier to operate compared to the imaginarium express train<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/imaginarium-power-steam-engine-set/dp/b007u7h4j6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">imaginarium power steam engine set</a>&nbsp;we bought before. both trains work on an aaa battery and the battery replacement is through the screw on the chimney. however, to reach the screw you need a thin and long screw driver for imaginarium whereas it is much more accsible for this model. besides, you do not need to allign the metal circuit bits that carefully with this model which is a pain for the other one.

-grasps the track well. that was the reason i returned our previous battery powered thomas&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/thomas-wooden-railway-battery-operated-thomas-the-tank-engine/dp/b009nffywm/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">thomas wooden railway - battery-operated thomas the tank engine</a>&nbsp;train which was not very much compatible with tracks other than thomas itself. the engine was unable to turn the curves and was getting off the track so frequently that it would not even complete one turn without the need for intervention. compared to that model, this grasps the track well and does not get out of the track even in the sharpest corners.

-small enough for thight spaces such as tunnels. bigger trains do not fit into fancy structures such as curved passage ways that are sold as accessories for some wooden track systems (we have an imaginarium express wooden track set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/imaginarium-timber-log-train-set/dp/b009ix0bls/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=utf8"">imaginarium timber log train set</a>&nbsp;which has curved elevations in narrow passages and bigger engines get stuck in those places)

cons:

-it is very simple with no attractive drawings on it. the imaginarium and thomas trains look way more appealing compared to this model.

-weak: it can climb elevations okay but at an extremely low speed. it almost feels like the battery is about to die very soon (even just after replacing it) aaa is the wrong choice for battery. it should have been an aa at least for proper and sustainable power thomas was a way stronger engine.

-you need many rechargable batteries since a single aaa does not even last an hour.

-price:.at $20 this is pricier than the previous models i had and i think it does not deserve more than $12-13.

there is a little basin on the bottom for each player. so the tube body part rotates so that when the marbles fall, it falls on that player's basin. but the frustrating thing is, the whole tube body is wobbly. just by rotating it, the balls could fall through and mess up the game. so this job isn't for little hands. i have to sit with the kids and rotate it for each player.

the other frustrating thing is there is no way to store the game without the marbles and sticks falling out. the box it came in is not a hard one so it's destroyed once opened. then the pieces don't just stack properly in order to just put the marbles and sticks together. there's just no way easy way of storing it so the pieces don't get lost.","fun for kids, but cheap quality",0.083,0.849,0.068,-0.8287

2.0,2,2013-02-19,A3ALIEK3IK3RVV,B00004YO0Y,"when my 3.5 year old saw the box he immediately wanted to try it out and go fishing.  he first tried it without a battery installed and was able to manage it ok.  the fishing poles like to swing a lot when you move them, so he had to hold the rod at the midpoint just to keep it still enough to get it in the fish's mouth.  now, once i installed the battery (1 c battery) and turned it on, the difficulty increased dramatically.  the game spins fairly fast and the fish don't have their mouths open for very long.  trying to hook one on a swinging fishing pole can become a little frustrating, even for me.  now i love a challenge, but if the playability of the game is more of a frustration than it is fun, then the game has lost its appeal.  the parts are cheaply made and i wouldn't be surprised if it didn't last very long.  out of the box, a number of the fish's stickered eyes had either fallen off or were missing.

it's a good game in that it helps to refine motor skills, but the application and construction of the game is a little too frustrating and disappointing to make it a worth while game.

and he had to hold them still this game is a little frusthere are four plastic fishing poles that pivot and rock when you move it.  you lower the pole over the fishes mouth and wait for it to open, but the fishing pole

to clear up a few things: 1) the game uses 1 c battery, not 2 aas. 2) there is no music as stated in the product description. 3) the fishing pole and fish are not magnetic as in other, smaller, wind-up versions of this game.

my biggest complaints are that it spins a little too fast, which means that the fish don't keep their mouths open for very long. and because the fishing pole is two plastic pieces with a small cone/cup shaped plastic knob (which is only a little smaller than the fish's mouths) instead of a magnet on a string as in the small, wind-up versions, catching fish isn't all that easy. it's not terribly hard, as i got the hang of it in a few minutes, but it's definitely not as easy as in the magnetic versions.

lastly, the reason some people have trouble putting the game back into its box is because some of the fish are still in their ""up"" positions (sticking up, with their mouths open). you just need to rotate it manually until all fish are in their ""down"" positions. but be sure to only rotate it the way the thing normally rotates, though, otherwise you might damage it.","good in concept, but can be a little frustrating",0.108,0.813,0.079,-0.9545

here you have a sturdy dual twisting set of ramps.  the slightest touch sets off an irritating electronic noise (presumably of race cars whizzing past) that you cannot turn off (fisher-price seems to have a thing against on-off switches on its toys).

placing two plastic race cars at the top of the ramps and starting them sends them spiraling downward at a rapid pace with the said noise reverberating around your eardrums.  if your child is playing with this on a carpet, the cars roll ahead about 4 inches; if he/she is playing on a hard floor, they roll a whopping 8 inches forward.  if you are not careful, the lightweight cars will end up underneath the sofa or tv stand, making them impossible to find again.

doesn't this sound exciting?

i tried very hard to get my son interested in this playset.  i set up the cars, ""revved"" the engines, and asked him to race my car.

he ignored me and continued playing with his mega blocks.

i really don't see what all the excitement is. this toy doesn't offer anything that sitting down a reading a book to your child doesn't. when just reading a story, the voice is flat and emotionless. not very exciting. my three-year-old can't seem to follow the directions (point to the green circle) and i don't know if she doesn't want to (she's independent) or doesn't quite understand. whith practice, hopefully she'll get better. some of the games are a little advanced, but might be better for a five-year-old, especially the rhyming games in ""wocket.""

the biggest problem, though, is the design. the on/off button is located in the lower right corner. if you're right handed, your wrist lays across the on/off button. it take barely any pressure to turn it on or off. the default on the volume is set to very, very low, so often she'll turn it on, not realize it's on, then turn it off trying to make it work.

the other mechanical problem is with the cartridges. if you have the wrong cartridge (or no cartridge) in, it sings songs, tells rymes, washes dishes -- everything except say, ""please insert the correct cartridge.""

1.0,12,2002-12-10,A1S7BFT0HDF3HA,B00005EB9M,"first, i have to agree with most other reviews posted already regarding both the incorrect answers and oddball questions. it's as though the creators tried to include only the weirdest situations or the most arcane notions. hence, the game is reduced largely to guessing multiple choice answers. because nearly every question and answer is so strange, it's hard to see what can be educational about the game.
still, in my opinion, what really plagues this game is that it is just not that much fun. basically, you move your game piece across the board a certain number of spaces determined solely by rolling the die. of course, you have to guess the answer first, and the younger kids are not going to have a clue. (hmmm, maybe there is a way to play without the questions. . . .) there are no obstacles on the way, and there is not way to send an opponent back home or into a tar pit or into a rattlesnake nest or some sort of worst case scenario that might instill some interest into this game.",weird case scenario,0.111,0.819,0.07,-0.8412
